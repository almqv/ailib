# AIlib
This is a lightweight AI library that works as a wrapper. 

## Installation
 1. `git clone https://github.com/E-Almqvist/ailib.git`
 2. Import it in your project and that is it.
 
## Usage
``` python
from ailib import ai

my_neural_network = ai.neural_network() # Create an object for your network
my_neural_network.generateLayers( [1, 1] ) # Generate 1 input neuron and 1 output neuron.

my_neural_network.think( [0.2] ) # Make the AI "think" about "0.2" and it will give out 1 output.

# This network does not really do anything usefull. 
```
See `example.py` for a better example.
